My name is Jacob Walker, and I am a PhD student at Imperial College London researching AI applications into healthcare.

Iâ€™m currently learning principles of ML, and Iâ€™m interested in AI/ML for drug design, digital healthcare, medical modelling, and solving biochemical problems.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything to do with AI/ML in the context of biomedical and molecular applications.
