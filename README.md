My name is Jacob Walker, and I am a Bioengineering masters student at Imperial College London.

Iâ€™m currently learning principles of ML, and Iâ€™m interested in AI/ML for drug design, healthcare, and solving biochemical problems.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything to do with AI/ML in the context of biomedical and molecular applications.
