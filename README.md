My name is Jacob Walker, and I am a final year undergrad at Imperial College

Iâ€™m currently learning principles of ML, and Iâ€™m interested in AI/ML for drug design and solving biochemical problems.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything to do with AI/ML in the context of molecular biochemistry
